<p align="center">This is <code>kbfinder</code>, a simple-to-use tool that queries posts on subreddits depending on your use case. Currently, the tool is being used to display reddit posts related to mechanical keyboards, allowing users to quickly find and return posts relating to that specific usage. Exlcusive use for <code>r/mechmarket</code> but more to come in the future.</p>
